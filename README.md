# CPSC1420 - Introduction to C++ Programming

CPSC1420, an introductory course to C++ programming. This course is about the fundamentals of C++ programming and gaining a solid foundation in writing code, understanding basic concepts, and output formatting.

## Course Overview

CPSC1420 covers the following key topics:

- Introduction to C++ syntax and programming principles
- Understanding and working with data types, variables, and operators
- Using control structures such as loops (including nested for loops) and conditionals
- Introduction to structs for organizing related data
- File reading and writing operations
- Basic input and output (I/O) operations
- Formatting output for improved readability

## Prerequisites

No prior programming experience is required for CPSC1420. However, a basic understanding of computer systems and concepts will be helpful. Familiarity with algebraic and logical expressions will also be beneficial.

## Course Structure

CPSC1420 consists of lectures, programming assignments, quizzes, and possibly a final project. The course material will be divided into modules, with each module covering specific topics and building upon the previous ones.
